# Open close principle

The open close principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself. This principle is important because it allows us to add new features to an application without changing the existing code.


It's using inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes to achieve this principle. By using these concepts, we can create a class that can be extended by other classes without modifying the original class.
